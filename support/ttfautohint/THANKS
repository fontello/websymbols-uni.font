The ttfautohint library has been written by Werner Lemberg <wl@gnu.org>.

It is largely based on the FreeType autohinting module, written by David
Turner <david@freetype.org>.


Special thanks to Dave Crossland <dave@understandingfonts.com> for proposing
the original idea, and to Raph Levien <http://raph.levien.com> and the
Google Web Fonts team <www.google.com/webfonts> for providing financial
support to initiate the project.

Thanks also to FontLab, Google (again) and all the other people who
contributed to the campaign at Pledgie <http://pledgie.com/campaigns/15816>
for continuing the financial support.


The following people have provided help in developing and testing the
library:

Dave Arnold <darnold@adobe.com>
Vernon Adams <vern@newtypography.co.uk>
James Cloos <cloos@jhcloos.com>
Greg Hitchcock <gregh@microsoft.com>
